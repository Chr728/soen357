## Description 
Project Watchdog was built using the website builder Wix. The repository contains custom scripts written for Wix pages, as well as the static output provided by Wix for the various site pages. To run this code, the appropriate pages must exist in Wix to maintain access to the internal Wix API. Then, each JS files must be given to Wix on the correct page so that the site may bundle the HTML, CSS, and JS files together for use. For example, a Settings page must be created in a manner defined by static/settings.html and the settings.js file given to it in Wix so that the page may be bundled by the website builder and be runnable.
